Only "you" see!

A text steganography simply readable only by "you", no complex calculation required.

Just memorize a relatively short-length integer as a *passcode*, forever, never share it with no one.

UC hides your secret text messages in high entropy cover text using a simple steganography scheme.

# Usage:
- Secret: the text you want to hide it.
- Passcode: an integer number that uncovers the hidden message.
- KeepSpaces: (yes/no) indicates that space characters [Spc] in secret message are encoded in covering message or ignored.

# Example.
Secret: "Sharp Eye"

Passcode = 2350
